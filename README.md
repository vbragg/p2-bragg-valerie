I had numerous problems with this assignment.

1. The JavaScript dropdown menu I could not get to work. When I would select one of them, all of them would drop down. I worked around it by putting them in separate JavaScript files with different classes and variable names.

2. I'm still not exactly sure how to use APIs. I can't seem to find the right file when I search for them. When I find a link, it's usually one line of code, which doesn't look right. For example, https://api.adviceslip.com/advice. I tried doing a Googlemap one as well that didn't work out.

3. When I merged one of my branches at the end, my index file completely changed. A lot of the work I had done on it had disappeared. I tried reverting back but couldn't get it. I ended up having to go back and recode some of it.
